# Argument Mirror

**Argument Mirror** is a lightweight browser‑based tool that helps you explore **both sides of an argument**.  
It guides you step‑by‑step:
1. Write your **own stance** on a topic.
2. Create a **counter‑argument** from the opposite perspective (with optional random prompts).
3. See both arguments **side‑by‑side** and compare tone, balance, and detail.
4. Get an **insight analysis** - keyword frequency, tone breakdown, bias check, and balance score.
5. **Download** a `.txt` summary of your work and reflections.

Designed for **critical thinking, debate prep, empathy‑building, and bias awareness**, all running 100% offline in your browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
